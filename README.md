# Luna's Café & Pie Shop
A simple e-commerce web app highlighting the use of Local Storage API and Geolocation API.
Inline Javascript was used for demonstration purposes.

As a base for showcasing features, a small and basic theme was created.
The shop's theme is centered around a fictional cat named Luna, who sells homemade pies.
