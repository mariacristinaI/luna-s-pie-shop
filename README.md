# Luna's Caf√© & Pie Shop
A simple e-commerce web app highlighting the use of SASS workflow, JS animation, Local Storage, Session Storage and Geolocation APIs.

As a base for showcasing features, a small and basic theme was created.
The shop's theme is centered around a fictional cat named Luna, who sells homemade pies.
